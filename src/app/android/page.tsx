          Delta is one of the most loved{" "}
          <span className="text-blue-600"> Roblox</span> executors right now.
          Before I explain how to download
          <span className="text-blue-600"> Delta Executor</span> , let me tell
          you that it is only available for Android and Windows at the moment.
        </p>

        <p className="text-white mt-2">
          Considering the love it has received over the last few months, the
          devs will soon launch Delta’s iOS and Mac version. As soon as its iOS
          and Mac version is out, we will write a guide explaining how to
          download and use it on those devices.

        <p className="text-white mt-2">
          What made <span className="text-blue-600">Delta Executor</span>{" "}
          instant hit among exploiters is it’s simple and user friendly UI and
          24×7 Customer Support. Irrespective of whether you have previously
          used an executor or not, you can easily use Delta Executor to run
          <span className="text-blue-600"> Roblox</span> scripts on your Mobile
          and PC.
        </p>

        <p className="text-white mt-2">
          When it comes to downloading, I recommend visiting its official
          website — Delta-executor.com. Unlike other websites, it will not ask
          you to visit any third-party website or download app to download the
          executor.

        <p className="text-white mt-2">
          To download Delta exploit, click on the below Download button and then
          click on the Download Latest. When you do so, you will have the
